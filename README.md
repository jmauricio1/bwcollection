# the black and white collection (v1.0)

### A collection and composition of black and white images from various photographers and artists on Unsplash.

The purpose of this project was to "play" with composition and unorthodox layouts for a web page. Some things I experimented with is parallax scrolling and positioning of elements.

The images on the webpage are not my own and belong to various artists and photographers. Please show them support and check them out on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
